# **App Name**: Crystal Visions AI

## Core Features:

- AI Design Suggestions: Generate personalized design suggestions based on user input, including crystal type, design style, and user intent. This tool uses AI to suggest optimal crystal combinations, arrangements, and photography settings.
- Interactive Design Configuration: Enable users to configure the details of their crystal jewelry designs using an interactive and intuitive interface. Options include design category (e.g., bracelet, necklace), main stones, arrangement style, accessories, and photography settings.
- Inspiration Image Analysis: Analyze user-uploaded images for design inspiration and extract key elements and color schemes. The tool will provide design recommendations based on the analyzed image, helping users achieve their desired aesthetic.
- Real-time Design Preview: Offer a real-time preview of the designed jewelry, showing how different configurations and settings affect the final product. The preview will update dynamically as users make changes to their design.
- Quick Design Mode: Simplify the design process with pre-defined templates and settings, allowing new users to quickly create basic designs.  It pre-configures crystal types and design elements to make it easier to get started with common designs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 60%, 60% - a medium-bright cyan (#4DB3E6).  Cyan aligns with the high-tech nature of the AI app, but without defaulting to overused blues; its brightness contrasts with the dark background.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 15% - a dark cyan (#1A262E). Dark backgrounds help reduce distractions and direct the eye to the subject of focus.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 50%, 50% - a bright turquoise (#40BFB1). Turquoise creates a distinct but still harmonious accent.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, modern look
- Use minimalist, geometric icons to represent crystal types, design elements, and settings.
- Implement a card-based layout with clear information hierarchy to present options and suggestions. Utilize an accordion style interface for detailed design configurations.
- Employ subtle animations and transitions, like fade-in effects and smooth scrolling, to enhance user engagement without being distracting.
